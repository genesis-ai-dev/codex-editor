# Splash Screen Implementation Plan

## Overview

The splash screen provides a visual indicator of Codex Editor's initialization progress, ensuring users don't interact with the application before it's fully loaded. It displays animated loading indicators and progress information using the Anime.js library.

## Current Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Completed)

- Created `SplashScreenProvider` to display initialization progress
- Integrated with existing timing tracking system in `extension.ts`
- Added Anime.js for animations
- Implemented a simple grid-based animation for the logo
- Shows loading stages and progress bar

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Improved Visual Design

- Create a more polished and branded loading animation
- Design a Codex Editor logo animation
- Enhance color scheme to better match VSCode themes
- Improve accessibility with better contrast and aria labels
- Add subtle background animations

### Phase 3: Performance Metrics

- Add detailed performance metrics display (optional toggle)
- Include memory usage statistics
- Show number of files being indexed
- Display estimated time remaining based on historical data

### Phase 4: Interactive Elements

- Add ability to skip certain non-critical initialization steps
- Provide links to documentation during loading
- Include quick tips about the editor while waiting
- Add diagnostic information for slow-loading components

### Phase 5: Integration with Welcome Screen

- Smooth transition from splash screen to welcome screen
- Remember user preferences about splash screen display
- Add option to disable splash screen for subsequent loads
- Intelligently show splash screen only for long loading operations

## Technical Requirements

1. **Anime.js Integration**

    - Use timeline animations for sequenced loading steps
    - Implement responsive animations that adapt to window size
    - Ensure animations are performant and don't add to load time

2. **VSCode Integration**

    - Ensure splash screen appears on top of all other UI elements
    - Handle window resize events properly
    - Support both light and dark themes

3. **Performance Considerations**

    - Minimize impact on startup time
    - Use efficient animations that don't consume excess resources
    - Lazy-load animation assets when possible

4. **Accessibility**
    - Ensure animations respect reduced motion settings
    - Provide text alternatives for all visual elements
    - Use ARIA attributes for screen readers

## Implementation Steps for Phase 2

1. Design new logo animation using Anime.js timeline
2. Update CSS to better match VSCode theme variables
3. Add more granular progress tracking
4. Improve transition animations between loading stages
5. Implement smooth closing animation
