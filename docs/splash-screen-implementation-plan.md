# Splash Screen Implementation Plan

## Overview

The splash screen provides a visual indicator of Codex Editor's initialization progress, ensuring users don't interact with the application before it's fully loaded. It displays animated loading indicators and progress information using the Anime.js library.

## Current Implementation

### Phase 1: Basic Functionality (Completed)

- ✅ Created `SplashScreenProvider` to display initialization progress
- ✅ Integrated with existing timing tracking system in `extension.ts`
- ✅ Added Anime.js for animations
- ✅ Implemented a simple grid-based animation for the logo
- ✅ Shows loading stages and progress bar

### Phase 2: Improved Visual Design (Completed)

- ✅ Created more polished and branded loading animation with book pages concept
- ✅ Designed Codex Editor book logo animation with page-turning effects
- ✅ Enhanced color scheme to better match VSCode themes with CSS variables
- ✅ Improved accessibility with ARIA attributes, screen reader support, and reduced motion preference
- ✅ Added subtle background particle animations
- ✅ Added responsive design for different screen sizes
- ✅ Improved loading stages display with scrollable area and timing information
- ✅ Added shimmer effects to progress bar
- ✅ Added smooth fade-in/fade-out transitions

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 3: Performance Metrics

- Add detailed performance metrics display (optional toggle)
- Include memory usage statistics
- Show number of files being indexed
- Display estimated time remaining based on historical data
- Add color-coded indication of slow loading steps

### Phase 4: Interactive Elements

- Add ability to skip certain non-critical initialization steps
- Provide links to documentation during loading
- Include quick tips about the editor while waiting
- Add diagnostic information for slow-loading components
- Allow expanding/collapsing detailed performance logs

### Phase 5: Integration with Welcome Screen

- Smooth transition from splash screen to welcome screen
- Remember user preferences about splash screen display
- Add option to disable splash screen for subsequent loads
- Intelligently show splash screen only for long loading operations
- Animate welcome screen entrance after splash screen closes

## Technical Requirements

1. **Anime.js Integration** ✅

    - ✅ Use timeline animations for sequenced loading steps
    - ✅ Implement responsive animations that adapt to window size
    - ✅ Ensure animations are performant and don't add to load time

2. **VSCode Integration** ✅

    - ✅ Ensure splash screen appears on top of all other UI elements
    - ✅ Handle window resize events properly
    - ✅ Support both light and dark themes

3. **Performance Considerations** ✅

    - ✅ Minimize impact on startup time
    - ✅ Use efficient animations that don't consume excess resources
    - ✅ Lazy-load animation assets when possible

4. **Accessibility** ✅
    - ✅ Ensure animations respect reduced motion settings
    - ✅ Provide text alternatives for all visual elements
    - ✅ Use ARIA attributes for screen readers

## Implementation Steps for Phase 3

1. Create a collapsible performance metrics panel
2. Add memory usage tracking using VSCode APIs
3. Track number of files processed during initialization
4. Implement time estimation based on historical loading data
5. Add a settings option to control metrics display detail level
