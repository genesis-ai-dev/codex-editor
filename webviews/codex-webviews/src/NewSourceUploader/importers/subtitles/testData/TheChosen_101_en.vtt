00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:51.468
<i>Abba?</i>

2
00:00:54.012 --> 00:00:56.348
-You should be sleeping, little one.
-I can't sleep.

3
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:58.308
Sit down, sit down.

4
00:00:59.601 --> 00:01:02.437
-Is your head hurting you again?
-No.

5
00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.233
I know. You were thinking
of the big new star.

6
00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:08.026
Hey, look, it's right there, see?

7
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.904
No.

8
00:01:11.572 --> 00:01:14.533
-Why can't you sleep?
-I'm scared.

9
00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:18.537
-Of what?
-I don't know.

10
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.708
Hey, what do we do when we are scared?

11
00:01:23.292 --> 00:01:26.461
-We say the words.
-Adonai's words.

12
00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:29.173
-From the prophet...
-Isaiah.

13
00:01:29.256 --> 00:01:31.633
The prophet Isaiah, right.

14
00:01:33.343 --> 00:01:37.306
"Thus says the Lord
who created you, O Jacob,

15
00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:40.976
and He who formed you, O Israel:

16
00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.520
Fear not."

17
00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.689
Come now, I want to hear you say it.

18
00:01:46.732 --> 00:01:48.692
I want to hear your pretty voice, come.

19
00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.987
"Fear not, for I have redeemed you;

20
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.948
I have called you by name. You are mine."

21
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:58.160
You are mine. That's right.

22
00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.991
Help! Somebody help me!

23
00:02:58.136 --> 00:02:59.388
She tried to kill me.

24
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:00.889
She tried to kill me.

25
00:03:00.973 --> 00:03:01.807
Somebody.

26
00:03:02.683 --> 00:03:03.517
Somebody!

27
00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.312
You filthy dog.

28
00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:13.610
Demons live inside her.

29
00:03:13.694 --> 00:03:15.153
Get back!

30
00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:32.606
Stop!

31
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:40.030
Forgive me, Rabbi.

32
00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:45.118
-Can you not see what he is doing?
-But, woman, ahead.

33
00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:21.697
-Why have you stopped us?
-It's not enough to say hello?

34
00:05:22.322 --> 00:05:23.949
I'm on official business.

35
00:05:24.032 --> 00:05:27.828
Only Roman business is official business.

36
00:05:29.705 --> 00:05:32.624
My name is Quintus.
I'm the praetor of Capernaum.

37
00:05:32.708 --> 00:05:35.377
-And I am--
-You are the great Nicodemus.

38
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.712
Word travels fast.

39
00:05:36.795 --> 00:05:38.422
Are you arresting me?

40
00:05:39.548 --> 00:05:41.508
No, my friend.

41
00:05:41.592 --> 00:05:43.719
I'm a magistrate, not a military man.

42
00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:46.346
I serve the will of the people and Pilate.

43
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:47.931
And I serve only God.

44
00:05:48.015 --> 00:05:49.933
Yes, yes.

45
00:05:50.017 --> 00:05:53.979
So do your enemies.
The Sadducees, the Essenes, the Zealots.

46
00:05:54.062 --> 00:05:58.817
Rogue preachers in the wilderness
raving about a coming Messiah.

47
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.403
They're all vying for the people's affection.

48
00:06:01.904 --> 00:06:05.574
-What do you want, Quintus?
-I believe taxes are going unpaid.

49
00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:11.079
If you help me, I will help
the Pharisees continue to thrive.

50
00:06:11.163 --> 00:06:15.250
How can I?
The people are already drowning in tax.

51
00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:22.758
Tell me, Nicodemus, what can be
under the water and yet never drown?

52
00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:26.720
Fish?

53
00:07:47.926 --> 00:07:48.886
Right here.

54
00:07:52.723 --> 00:07:54.057
Keep your voice down.

55
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:56.518
Pardon me, Mr. Public-anus.

56
00:07:56.602 --> 00:07:58.395
It's me that don't want to be seen with you.

57
00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.730
It's "publicanus."

58
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:01.815
I like it the other way, taxman.

59
00:08:01.899 --> 00:08:03.442
Hey, hey, hey!

60
00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:05.777
It's a month's salary
for all my sons combined right there.

61
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:07.112
You just toss them out?

62
00:08:07.196 --> 00:08:09.781
These are my property.
I do with them as I wish.

63
00:08:09.865 --> 00:08:14.328
I pay you to drive,
you sift through trash on your own time.

64
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:16.580
Driving you's a bit of both now, isn't it?

65
00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.375
If any citizen asks about my cargo,
I must tell the truth.

66
00:08:21.043 --> 00:08:24.129
It's the biggest pile of dung
in all Capernaum.

67
00:08:26.882 --> 00:08:28.383
Now, honestly,

68
00:08:28.467 --> 00:08:32.012
I always look forward
to my annual visit to Capernaum

69
00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:35.807
and your magnificent Sea of Galilee.

70
00:08:35.891 --> 00:08:38.227
It is truly the envy of the kingdom.

71
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.025
Even my children are enamored of it.

72
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:51.740
All day they would swim,
frolic in the sand and watch the people.

73
00:08:51.823 --> 00:08:53.575
Finally, one day I said,

74
00:08:53.659 --> 00:08:57.663
"You love it here so much,
why is it you never go to the sea

75
00:08:57.746 --> 00:08:59.873
when we visit
your grandparents back home?"

76
00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:03.335
My son, he just shrugged
and said, "But, Father,

77
00:09:03.418 --> 00:09:06.088
there's never anyone there, it's dead."

78
00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:13.887
And your sea boasts
the most exquisite fish.

79
00:09:16.181 --> 00:09:17.307
How unfortunate...

80
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:22.771
that those who do the actual fishing
are unholy, foulmouthed,

81
00:09:22.855 --> 00:09:25.148
given to gambling in secret dens.

82
00:09:25.232 --> 00:09:27.734
Even fishing on Shabbat.

83
00:09:27.818 --> 00:09:32.447
Can we eat the catch
and not be stained by the sins of the catcher?

84
00:09:32.531 --> 00:09:37.035
Make no mistake,
it is a sin to eat fish caught on Shabbat.

85
00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:39.997
What goes into the body
of a man defiles him.

86
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.752
Why are our Jewish brethren
taking their boats to sea on Shabbat?

87
00:09:45.836 --> 00:09:49.214
I assure you, the Messiah will not come

88
00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:52.968
until this wickedness is purged from our midst.

89
00:09:53.051 --> 00:09:55.679
Your actions are being watched, studied.

90
00:09:55.762 --> 00:10:00.142
God has entrusted you
to be exemplary in every way.

91
00:10:00.726 --> 00:10:04.479
Now, if your status is too great a burden,

92
00:10:04.563 --> 00:10:07.566
you do not deserve
to bear the name of Israel.

93
00:10:12.404 --> 00:10:14.781
I want to see my reflection in it
as plain as day.

94
00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:16.783
This teacher has traveled
all the way from Judea.

95
00:10:16.867 --> 00:10:18.869
He is a member
of the great Sanhedrin in Jerusalem,

96
00:10:18.952 --> 00:10:21.246
and I won't have him seated at a dull table.

97
00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.334
Yussif, fix your tallit.

98
00:10:30.797 --> 00:10:31.840
Here he comes.

99
00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:34.760
Away, go, get the others.

100
00:10:34.843 --> 00:10:37.679
Adonai's blessing upon us
to have you here.

101
00:10:40.849 --> 00:10:42.559
-Rabbi.
-Rabbi.

102
00:10:42.643 --> 00:10:45.729
Teacher, you have moved us all.

103
00:10:46.688 --> 00:10:47.773
Shmuel.

104
00:10:47.856 --> 00:10:50.275
Will you do us the honor, Rabbi?

105
00:10:50.359 --> 00:10:52.945
If that's where you keep the white sardines.

106
00:10:57.324 --> 00:10:58.867
We certainly could get--

107
00:10:58.951 --> 00:11:01.537
It was a joke, Shmuel.

108
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:12.464
A fine Torah room is the heartbeat
of a worthy synagogue, Shmuel.

109
00:11:12.548 --> 00:11:14.633
Thank you, teacher of Israel,
you do us a great honor.

110
00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.762
The honor is mine,
not only for your bright students,

111
00:11:18.846 --> 00:11:22.599
but also for the soul of this city.

112
00:11:22.683 --> 00:11:24.601
-You heard my address.
-Of course.

113
00:11:24.685 --> 00:11:28.689
-Your words will resonate for generations.
-You were luminous.

114
00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:33.402
In my remarks,
I asked for rhetorical purposes,

115
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:37.072
"Why are Jews taking boats
to sea on Shabbat?"

116
00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:40.868
That question
was meant for you, Rabbi Shmuel.

117
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:43.537
The reports are becoming
too frequent to ignore.

118
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:46.999
Of course, Rabbi, we-- I will control it better.

119
00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:50.419
The Romans believe we do not work
on Sabbath, thus they do not patrol.

120
00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:54.631
-Greed has overcome the fishermen.
-Or they are just trying to feed their families.

121
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.927
Begging your pardon, Rabbi.
The centurion is here.

122
00:11:59.011 --> 00:12:00.637
He demands to speak with you.

123
00:12:00.721 --> 00:12:03.515
Please tell him we have an honored guest
and cannot be interrupted.

124
00:12:03.599 --> 00:12:06.226
-It can't wait.
-Messiah, come quickly.

125
00:12:09.062 --> 00:12:10.355
Impressive.

126
00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.817
Looks like we're not
the only ones taxing the people.

127
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:16.445
What do you want, commander?

128
00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:19.114
I'm no commander
but at least you know your place.

129
00:12:19.198 --> 00:12:23.202
This is Nicodemus, teacher of teachers.
Show some respect.

130
00:12:23.285 --> 00:12:25.120
Just the man I want to see.

131
00:12:25.204 --> 00:12:28.248
I'm here about a Hebrew woman
in the Red Quarter.

132
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:31.543
Let's just say
she's been causing a disturbance.

133
00:12:31.627 --> 00:12:34.379
You have an entire
Roman legion at your disposal.

134
00:12:34.463 --> 00:12:36.632
Thank you for the reminder, Jew.

135
00:12:36.715 --> 00:12:38.800
But she needs a holy man.

136
00:12:38.884 --> 00:12:41.428
We are men of God.

137
00:12:41.512 --> 00:12:45.349
It is not our custom
to frequent the Red Quarter.

138
00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:49.228
Perhaps I wasn't clear, teacher of teachers.

139
00:12:49.311 --> 00:12:55.317
You'll accompany me to the Red Quarter
or we'll burn it down with our fire of fires.

140
00:13:08.914 --> 00:13:10.290
This is your stop.

141
00:13:12.876 --> 00:13:15.212
Wait, this is the far side of the market.

142
00:13:15.295 --> 00:13:17.339
-Get out.
-No.

143
00:13:17.422 --> 00:13:19.591
-No?
-This is the job.

144
00:13:19.675 --> 00:13:23.387
-You drive so I don't walk through the market.
-It's too crowded. Out!

145
00:13:24.555 --> 00:13:25.639
I'll pay you double.

146
00:13:25.722 --> 00:13:30.644
Money won't buy the stink off me
and my family if I am seen with you.

147
00:13:30.727 --> 00:13:31.687
Out!

148
00:13:39.444 --> 00:13:41.029
This is very unprofessional.

149
00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:42.447
Fire me.

150
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:02.217
Two, please.

151
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.150
Tax collector, go!

152
00:14:19.484 --> 00:14:21.153
Look, there he is.

153
00:14:23.405 --> 00:14:24.448
I see him.

154
00:14:34.917 --> 00:14:37.377
Please. Are you the Messiah?

155
00:14:37.461 --> 00:14:39.505
-Are you the Messiah?
-No, I'm not.

156
00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:42.591
Please. Tell me when he comes.

157
00:14:43.258 --> 00:14:44.092
Please.

158
00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.115
You're late, Gaius.

159
00:15:07.199 --> 00:15:08.075
I know.

160
00:15:09.409 --> 00:15:10.827
Could you feel it?

161
00:15:11.328 --> 00:15:13.830
-Feel what?
-The market, it's on fire today.

162
00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.123
Everybody's on edge.

163
00:15:15.207 --> 00:15:18.252
All it would take is one person
to snap and you are...

164
00:15:21.171 --> 00:15:22.965
Just do your job.

165
00:15:23.048 --> 00:15:24.258
Better hope.

166
00:16:17.477 --> 00:16:19.813
Upstairs, Rivka's place.

167
00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.609
Don't worry, Rabbi.

168
00:16:23.692 --> 00:16:27.196
We took out the other lowlifes
to protect your delicate sensibilities.

169
00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.116
What is that?

170
00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.247
I need materials. Shmuel!

171
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:44.379
Sulfur, nettles, hyssop, wormwood.

172
00:16:44.463 --> 00:16:45.756
-Go!
-Yes, teacher.

173
00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:55.390
Well, do your job.

174
00:16:58.435 --> 00:17:02.981
Listen, I agreed to Quintus's request,

175
00:17:03.065 --> 00:17:06.443
not a demand, because
he should not demand anything of me...

176
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:09.863
to stop Shabbat fishing,
which was already our law,

177
00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:12.991
and by doing so
was not a violation of my practice.

178
00:17:13.075 --> 00:17:18.330
And I will try to help this woman,
even though it falls outside of my purview.

179
00:17:18.413 --> 00:17:22.292
But do not think of me as a tool
to fix Roman problems.

180
00:17:22.918 --> 00:17:26.463
I will not continue to use
my position of religious influence

181
00:17:26.547 --> 00:17:29.466
to benefit those
who look down on my people,

182
00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.427
whether it's you
or even someone like Quintus.

183
00:17:33.262 --> 00:17:39.434
So I will perform this task
but I want it noted for your superiors,

184
00:17:39.518 --> 00:17:41.353
this is an exception!

185
00:17:44.147 --> 00:17:45.274
So can we go now?

186
00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:48.443
Yes.

187
00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:56.660
Stay down, Simon.

188
00:17:56.743 --> 00:17:58.036
Come on, Simon. Get up.

189
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:01.957
Suck dirt if you know what is good for you.

190
00:18:05.878 --> 00:18:07.337
Pay me, pay me, pay me, let's go.

191
00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:23.312
You're too much, Jehosaphat.

192
00:18:23.395 --> 00:18:24.438
You're too powerful.

193
00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:25.689
That's right.

194
00:18:26.565 --> 00:18:29.610
Like I tell you every time I see you.

195
00:18:29.693 --> 00:18:30.986
Like I tell my sister.

196
00:18:36.825 --> 00:18:41.455
Seriously, I can only take maybe two, one...

197
00:18:43.832 --> 00:18:46.084
One more punch. One more and I'm done.

198
00:18:46.168 --> 00:18:47.628
He says he's had it.

199
00:18:57.387 --> 00:18:58.222
Jeho?

200
00:19:02.267 --> 00:19:04.186
What was it you were saying?

201
00:19:05.646 --> 00:19:07.397
Something about your sister?

202
00:19:10.859 --> 00:19:14.988
You think if you keep hitting me hard enough,
I won't be married to her anymore?

203
00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:21.662
That's why they call me "Wine Hands,"
because of what I do to your liver.

204
00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.832
-They can't take away their bet?
-No. Don't worry.

205
00:19:25.916 --> 00:19:29.837
I don't wanna do this, Jehosaphat.
Can we please stop fighting every week?

206
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.465
I know you never trusted me, but
I love your sister more than anything.

207
00:19:33.549 --> 00:19:35.884
I will stop fighting you.

208
00:19:35.968 --> 00:19:37.052
You will?

209
00:19:39.555 --> 00:19:42.641
-But my brother won't.
-Your brother?

210
00:19:59.283 --> 00:20:03.161
Where's it written down, Andrew, huh?
Answer me that?

211
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:05.706
I'm so foolish.

212
00:20:05.789 --> 00:20:08.917
Look, how's a double knockout a push,
if it's two on one?

213
00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:10.377
Made-up rule, right there.

214
00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:13.755
Made up or in stone, who cares?

215
00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:17.134
We lost, and I know better.

216
00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:22.389
No, no, it's my fault. I talked you into it.

217
00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.523
"Wine Hands"?

218
00:20:33.609 --> 00:20:35.736
Sounded more clever in my head.

219
00:20:41.408 --> 00:20:42.659
Tax day's coming.

220
00:20:45.037 --> 00:20:47.873
Two sunrises away, Shabbat, and then--

221
00:20:47.956 --> 00:20:50.417
I realize, Simon, thank you.

222
00:20:52.628 --> 00:20:54.171
We could lose the boat.

223
00:20:55.506 --> 00:20:56.673
What are you gonna do?

224
00:20:58.383 --> 00:20:59.551
Don't know.

225
00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.763
Blood from a stone.

226
00:21:10.896 --> 00:21:13.857
-Where are you going?
-Going to work.

227
00:21:14.316 --> 00:21:17.027
Work? It's Shabbat in an hour.

228
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:20.531
Well, the Pharisees make allowances
for that if lives are at stake.

229
00:21:20.614 --> 00:21:24.952
-No one's life is at stake.
-No, no, not this moment, but it's coming.

230
00:21:26.411 --> 00:21:29.289
What, are you gonna tell
your bug-eating friend about it?

231
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:34.586
No, no, no. Just me.

232
00:21:34.670 --> 00:21:36.839
-Not dragging you into this.
-What about Eden?

233
00:21:36.922 --> 00:21:40.634
-She's staying at her <i>eema's</i> tonight.
-You're crazy, you know that?

234
00:21:41.343 --> 00:21:44.304
Nah, just desperate.

235
00:21:56.024 --> 00:21:58.485
-How long has she been like this?
-Like what?

236
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:02.406
I'm trying to help her, Rivka.

237
00:22:02.489 --> 00:22:04.658
All you're gonna do is mess this place up.

238
00:22:05.409 --> 00:22:06.368
Then what?

239
00:22:06.451 --> 00:22:08.871
You're gonna stop by
and help clean, Rabbi?

240
00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:12.666
The demons that torment her soul
will turn your place to dust.

241
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:14.918
Even if you care nothing
for her soul, at least--

242
00:22:15.002 --> 00:22:17.921
Lilith never hurt anyone
that didn't hurt her first.

243
00:22:19.298 --> 00:22:20.507
Mostly.

244
00:22:21.216 --> 00:22:22.885
She has these spells.

245
00:22:22.968 --> 00:22:25.679
We let her be and then
she's as sweet as an angel again.

246
00:22:28.557 --> 00:22:30.267
Curse it all, Lil!

247
00:22:37.941 --> 00:22:39.818
You can put an end to this?

248
00:23:01.089 --> 00:23:02.966
I adjure you...

249
00:23:05.636 --> 00:23:07.971
by the holy angels...

250
00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:12.476
Michael, Gabriel, Rafael, Uriel and Raziel.

251
00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:19.149
I adjure you, cursed dragon
and diabolical legions.

252
00:23:19.691 --> 00:23:20.609
Come out!

253
00:23:21.568 --> 00:23:25.989
I adjure you spawn of Beelzebub,

254
00:23:26.073 --> 00:23:28.033
Abbadon and Sheol!

255
00:23:28.116 --> 00:23:31.870
By the utterance of all
the watchers and the holy ones.

256
00:23:31.954 --> 00:23:36.291
In the name of Adonai, God of the heavens,

257
00:23:36.375 --> 00:23:40.254
cease to deceive this human creature.

258
00:23:47.302 --> 00:23:52.099
I command you, in covenant with Abraham,

259
00:23:52.683 --> 00:23:57.062
in the names of Jacob, Isaac, Moses.

260
00:23:57.604 --> 00:24:00.816
The all-powerful El Shaddai.

261
00:24:02.359 --> 00:24:04.695
Fly from this innocent soul.

262
00:24:31.722 --> 00:24:33.932
We are not afraid of you.

263
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.271
You have no power here, teacher.

264
00:24:49.406 --> 00:24:50.616
We're finished here.

265
00:25:46.255 --> 00:25:47.339
Simon.

266
00:25:50.884 --> 00:25:53.470
-Hello, love.
-Don't you "hello, love" me.

267
00:25:54.012 --> 00:25:55.597
Why did you beat up Jehosaphat?

268
00:25:56.223 --> 00:25:58.183
-What?
-My own brother.

269
00:25:58.267 --> 00:26:00.727
He attacked me, again.

270
00:26:00.811 --> 00:26:03.397
He needs to know
the husband of his sister is strong.

271
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.941
But Andrew had no right
to jump Abrahim from behind.

272
00:26:06.024 --> 00:26:07.776
Where are you getting this?

273
00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.284
My brothers.
They are fantastic storytellers, no?

274
00:26:15.367 --> 00:26:18.203
Tellers of fantastic stories, yes, they are.

275
00:26:18.287 --> 00:26:21.707
They went into such great detail.
You must've really given them a pounding.

276
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:25.294
Well, I was doing okay
until Abe came out of nowhere.

277
00:26:25.377 --> 00:26:27.212
Cost me and Andrew a lot of money.

278
00:26:27.296 --> 00:26:31.175
Oh, no. They shouldn't cheat you like that
when you were also cheating.

279
00:26:31.258 --> 00:26:33.468
All right, all right.

280
00:26:34.303 --> 00:26:37.347
Well, pardon me for saying so,
love, but your family--

281
00:26:37.431 --> 00:26:39.224
-Don't.
-What?

282
00:26:39.308 --> 00:26:42.769
Don't you say that my family
is troubled in the mind, Simon.

283
00:26:42.853 --> 00:26:44.563
Okay.

284
00:26:45.397 --> 00:26:48.108
We are colorful and fun.

285
00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:52.154
You are stoic and purposeful.

286
00:26:54.364 --> 00:26:57.534
-You think I'm stoic?
-Well, compared to me.

287
00:26:58.744 --> 00:27:00.913
Together, we're perfection.

288
00:27:08.170 --> 00:27:09.671
Stoic, huh?

289
00:27:10.214 --> 00:27:12.090
Never heard that before.

290
00:27:12.174 --> 00:27:13.425
I like it.

291
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:18.263
You and me, fire and water.

292
00:27:19.515 --> 00:27:20.933
I like it.

293
00:27:23.769 --> 00:27:25.979
Oh, how was <i>Eema's</i> Shabbat dinner?

294
00:27:26.063 --> 00:27:27.272
It was lovely.

295
00:27:28.023 --> 00:27:29.608
How was fishing?

296
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:32.110
-What?
-Yesterday's catch?

297
00:27:32.194 --> 00:27:33.237
Good news?

298
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:35.155
Oh, yeah.

299
00:27:36.114 --> 00:27:37.991
Yeah, pulled something in, could be big.

300
00:27:38.075 --> 00:27:40.953
Good, let's go to synagogue.

301
00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:44.831
And please go change. You still smell.

302
00:27:56.385 --> 00:27:59.555
What do we do when we are scared?

303
00:27:59.638 --> 00:28:01.223
We say the words.

304
00:28:01.306 --> 00:28:02.683
Adonai's words.

305
00:28:03.392 --> 00:28:06.812
"Thus says the Lord who created you,
O Jacob,

306
00:28:07.521 --> 00:28:13.485
and He who formed you, O Israel:
Fear not."

307
00:28:29.585 --> 00:28:31.128
They're gonna save the rest.

308
00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:41.305
Get away!

309
00:28:50.647 --> 00:28:51.481
Get away!

310
00:29:21.136 --> 00:29:22.179
<i>Abba?</i>

311
00:30:00.592 --> 00:30:04.805
"Thus said the Lord who formed you,
O Jacob,

312
00:30:06.974 --> 00:30:11.603
and He who created you, O Israel:
Fear not."

313
00:30:46.889 --> 00:30:47.848
"Fear--"

314
00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.602
"Fear not, for I have created..."

315
00:31:25.093 --> 00:31:26.595
<i>Chaverim maqqaba.</i>

316
00:31:52.746 --> 00:31:53.622
Lili!

317
00:31:55.165 --> 00:31:56.291
You're alive!

318
00:32:01.088 --> 00:32:02.881
We heard there was trouble.

319
00:32:02.965 --> 00:32:05.259
Come, sit.
