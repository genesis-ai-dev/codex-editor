**Understanding the Cell Structure:**

3. Translate the text (images stay in place)
4. Images are preserved automatically

**Example:**
```
Cell 1 (Image): [Preserved from source]
Cell 2 (Text):  "In the beginning..." ‚Üí [Your translation]
Cell 3 (Image): [Preserved from source]
Cell 4 (Text):  "God created..." ‚Üí [Your translation]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't Find OBS Importer

**Solution:**
- Look in "Specialized" section (not "Essential")
- Search for "Bible Stories" or "OBS"
- Should have "Round-trip" tag

### Problem: "Not imported with OBS importer" Error

**Cause:** File was imported with old version or different importer

**Solution:**
1. Delete the current notebook
2. Re-import using updated OBS importer
3. Re-translate content

### Problem: Missing Images in Export

**Check:**
- Images should be in original markdown as `![alt](url)`
- Image cells are preserved (not deleted)
- Network access for CDN images

**Solution:**
- Images are referenced by URL, not embedded
- Ensure original markdown had proper image links

### Problem: Translation Not Appearing

**Check:**
- Translated **codex** notebook (not source)
- Only **text cells** are exported (not image cells)
- HTML is stripped automatically

**Solution:**
- Make sure you edited text cells in codex notebook
- Images are preserved but not editable

## üåç Multi-Language Projects

**Scenario:** Translating OBS into multiple languages

**Workflow:**
1. Import once (creates source + codex)
2. Duplicate codex notebook for each language
3. Rename: `01-spanish.codex`, `01-french.codex`, etc.
4. Translate each
5. Export all at once (Rebuild Export detects all)

**Result:**
```
01_2024-10-22_spanish_translated.md
01_2024-10-22_french_translated.md
01_2024-10-22_german_translated.md
```

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Can I edit images?**

**Q: What about verse references?**
A: OBS doesn't use verse references, only story numbers and segments.
